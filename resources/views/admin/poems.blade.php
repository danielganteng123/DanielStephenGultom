                     <p>If I were another on the road, I would not have looked</p>
                     <p>back, I would have said what one traveler said</p>
                     <p>to another: Stranger! awaken</p>
                     <p>the guitar more! Delay our tomorrow so our road</p>
                     <p>may extend and space may widen for us, and we may get rescued</p>
                     <p>from our story together: you are so much yourself ... and I am</p>
                     <p>so much other than myself right here before you!

                    <p>If I were another I would have belonged to the road,</p>
                    <p>neither you nor I would return. Awaken the guitar</p>
                    <p>and we might sense the unknown and the route that tempts</p>
                    <p>the traveler to test gravity. I am only</p>
                    <p>my steps, and you are both my compass and my chasm.</p>
                    <p>If I were another on the road, I would have</p>
                    <p>hidden my emotions in the suitcase, so my poem</p>
                    <p>would be of water, diaphanous, white,</p>
                    <p>abstract, and lightweight ... stronger than memory,</p>
                    <p>and weaker than dewdrops, and I would have said:</p>
                    <p>My identity is this expanse!</p>

                <div><br></div>

                    <p>If I were another on the road, I would have said</p>
                    <p>to the guitar: Teach me an extra string!</p>
                    <p>Because the house is farther, and the road to it prettier—</p>
                    <p>that’s what my new song would say. Whenever</p>
                    <p>the road lengthens the meaning renews, and I become two</p>
                    <p>on this road: I ... and another!</p>
